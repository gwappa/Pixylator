Pixylator plugin
=================

Pixylator is a color-tracking plugin for ImageJ. It uses Video I/O, which in turn engages [JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp) and [JavaCPP-presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets) to access features of [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).


How to use
-----------

1. download [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).
2. download Pixylator_build.zip.
3. extract the zip file and copy the resulting directory into ImageJ's "plugin" directory.
4. (re)open ImageJ. "Pixylator" menu will show up in the Plugins menu.
